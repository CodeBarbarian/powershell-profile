### Fast Debugging (Non Interruptive Module Import)

Debugging a module and don't wanna reload the entire powershell profile?

Go into the Module Directory where the module you wanna debug is:

```powershell
cd /Application/Int-Modules/ModuleName/
```
Issue the following command: 
```Powershell
Register-DebugTask -ModuleName ModuleName
```

Now, whenever you wanna reload that specific module just run Resolve-DebugTask
```powershell
Resolve-DebugTask
```
